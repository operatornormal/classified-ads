"and ask for address of her node to make initial contact with the network. "
"Once connected the software should maintain list of addresses of other "
"nodes. </p><p>Due to its server-less design the whole system works best if "
"you leave the program running always when you have your computer powered "
"on ; while processing other operators requests it will hog some computing "
"resources and generate network traffic also when you are not actively using "
"the program yourself - others are. </p><p>Operators concerned about privacy "
"of the content should be aware of following items:</p><p>- Data storage "
"implementation is variant of <span style=\" font-style:italic;\">distributed "
"hash table</span>, practically meaning that content posted by you gets "
"copied some more-or-less random nodes in the network. </p><p>- Any data item "
"(ad, comment, binary file, private message etc.) is digitally signed. This "
"makes it more difficult to try to pose as another operator. </p><p>- "
"Operators are reliably identified only by the SHA1 hash of their generated "
"encryption keys. SHA1 hash is displayed when viewing details of operator "
"profiles. Other identifying information like nickname or city name are "
"entered by operator himself and can be anything. The operator profile, as it "
"is published to the network, is also signed with the encryption keys of the "
"operator - if you identify an operator by her SHA1 hash, you have a "
"mechanism for identifying if any content inside classified ads is posted by "
"this operator or not. Classified ads internally checks for digital "
"signatures, throwing away content that fails signature check and tries to "
"provide SHA1 hash of the operator who posted the content.</p><p>- All "
"classified ads are posted as plain text, no encryption is used. All public "
"profiles are posted as plain text, no encryption is used. If profile is made "
"private, it is encrypted to be readable only by selected other profiles. "
"This applies also to binary files shared by operators private profiles and "
"comments about private profiles after the profile was made private "
"(previously plain-text comments or files don't get magically encrypted "
"afterwards). Private messages are encrypted always to be readable only by "
"recipient and sender. Attachments follow the privacy rules of the document, "
"they're attached to. </p><p>- As is the case with all internet-"
"communications, this small fact is true for classified ads too : <span style="
"\" font-style:italic;\">once something gets posted online, there is no way "
"to remove it from network</span>. </p><p>- Data encryption implementation "
"for content is OpenSSL, relying mostly on algorithms RSA-2048 and AES-256. </"
"p><p>- While connections between nodes are implemented using SSL, other "
"nodes inside network do get to know what content is being transmitted in "
"neighboring nodes. While there is no central point for easily collecting "
"this information about particular classification or operator, operators "
"still should expect no privacy regarding their doings online, although some "
"effort has been been put into hiding <span style=\" font-style:italic;"
"\">contents</span> of private messages and private profiles. </"
