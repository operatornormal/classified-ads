#| "Järvinen 2013. </p><p>Main feature of the the program is an "
#| "&quot;advertisement&quot; - a piece of text belonging to selected "
#| "classification. There are several pre-programmed classifications and "
#| "operators are encouraged to invent new classifications for new purposes ; "
#| "the selection boxes in classification-selection tab are editable. Other "
#| "operators may then view the ads, publicly comment the ads, the operators "
#| "and also send private messages to each others. </p><p>Another important "
#| "feature of classified ads is that it is designed to be operated without "
#| "any centralized server infrastucture - it is you and other operators "
#| "whose computers store and transmit all the content visible inside "
#| "classified ads. To get connected you need to know address of at least one "
#| "existing computer (a <span style=\" font-style:italic;\">node</span>) so "
#| "if your network connection dialog shows no connections, you may need to "
#| "contact someone you know is using the software and ask for address of her "
#| "node to make initial contact with the network. Once connected the "
#| "software should maintain list of addresses of other nodes. </p><p>Due to "
#| "its server-less design the whole system works best if you leave the "
#| "program running always when you have your computer powered on ; while "
#| "processing other operators requests it will hog some computing resources "
#| "and generate network traffic also when you are not actively using the "
#| "program youself - others are. </p><p>Operators concerned about privacy of "
#| "the content should be aware of following items:</p><p>- Data storage "
#| "implementation is variant of <span style=\" "
#| "font-style:italic;\">distributed hash table</span>, practically meaning "
#| "that content posted by you gets copied some more-or-less random nodes in "
#| "the network. </p><p>- Any data item (ad, comment, binary file, private "
#| "message etc.) is digitally signed. This makes it more difficult to try to "
#| "pose as another operator. </p><p>- Operators are reliably identified only "
#| "by the SHA1 hash of their generated encryption keys. SHA1 hash is "
#| "displayed when viewing details of operator profiles. Other identifying "
#| "information like nickname or city name are entered by operator himself "
#| "and can be anything. The operator profile, as it is published to the "
#| "network, is also signed with the encryption keys of the operator - if you "
#| "identify an operator by her SHA1 hash, you have a mechanism for "
#| "identifying if any content inside classified ads is posted by this "
#| "operator or not. Classified ads internally checks for digital signatures, "
#| "throwing away content that fails signature check and tries to provide "
#| "SHA1 hash of the operator who posted the content.</p><p>- All classified "
#| "ads are posted as plain text, no encryption is used. All public profiles "
#| "are posted as plain text, no encryption is used. If profile is made "
#| "private, it is encrypted to be readable only by selected other profiles. "
#| "This applies also to binary files shared by operators private profiles "
#| "and comments about private profiles after the profile was made private "
#| "(previously plain-text comments or files don't get magically encrypted "
#| "afterwards). Private messages are encrypted always to be readable only by "
#| "recipient and sender. Attachments follow the privary rules of the "
#| "document, they're attachted to. </p><p>- As is the case with all "
#| "internet-communications, this small fact is true for classified ads too : "
#| "<span style=\" font-style:italic;\">once something gets posted online, "
#| "there is no way to remove it from network</span>. </p><p>- Data "
#| "encryption implementation for content is OpenSSL, relying mostly on "
#| "algorithms RSA-2048 and AES-256. </p><p>- While connections between nodes "
#| "are implemented using SSL, other nodes inside network do get to know what "
#| "content is being transmitted in neighboring nodes. While there is no "
#| "central point for easily collecting this information about particular "
#| "classification or operator, operators still should expect no privacy "
#| "regarding their doings online, although some effort has been been put "
#| "into hiding <span style=\" font-style:italic;\">contents</span> of "

"<html><head/><body><p>Classified ads is free software. You may use, copy and "
"modify it if you follow the conditions given in GNU lesser general public "
"license version 2.1.</p><p>Classified ads is copyright © Antti Järvinen "
"2013. </p><p>Main feature of the program is an &quot;advertisement&quot; - a "
"piece of text belonging to selected classification. There are several "
"pre-programmed classifications and operators are encouraged to invent new "
"classifications for new purposes ; the selection boxes in "
"classification-selection tab are editable. Other operators may then view the "
"ads, publicly comment the ads, the operators and also send private messages "
"to each others. </p><p>Another important feature of classified ads is that "
"it is designed to be operated without any centralized server infrastructure "
"- it is you and other operators whose computers store and transmit all the "
"content visible inside classified ads. To get connected you need to know "
"address of at least one existing computer (a <span style=\" "
"font-style:italic;\">node</span>) so if your network connection dialog shows "
"no connections, you may need to contact someone you know is using the "
"software and ask for address of her node to make initial contact with the "
"network. Once connected the software should maintain list of addresses of "
"other nodes. </p><p>Due to its server-less design the whole system works "
"best if you leave the program running always when you have your computer "
"powered on ; while processing other operators requests it will hog some "
"computing resources and generate network traffic also when you are not "
"actively using the program yourself - others are. </p><p>Operators concerned "
"about privacy of the content should be aware of following items:</p><p>- "
"Data storage implementation is variant of <span style=\" "
"font-style:italic;\">distributed hash table</span>, practically meaning that "
"content posted by you gets copied some more-or-less random nodes in the "
"network. </p><p>- Any data item (ad, comment, binary file, private message "
"etc.) is digitally signed. This makes it more difficult to try to pose as "
"another operator. </p><p>- Operators are reliably identified only by the "
"SHA1 hash of their generated encryption keys. SHA1 hash is displayed when "
"viewing details of operator profiles. Other identifying information like "
"nickname or city name are entered by operator himself and can be anything. "
"The operator profile, as it is published to the network, is also signed with "
"the encryption keys of the operator - if you identify an operator by her "
"SHA1 hash, you have a mechanism for identifying if any content inside "
"classified ads is posted by this operator or not. Classified ads internally "
"checks for digital signatures, throwing away content that fails signature "
"check and tries to provide SHA1 hash of the operator who posted the "
"content.</p><p>- All classified ads are posted as plain text, no encryption "
"is used. All public profiles are posted as plain text, no encryption is "
"used. If profile is made private, it is encrypted to be readable only by "
"selected other profiles. This applies also to binary files shared by "
"operators private profiles and comments about private profiles after the "
"profile was made private (previously plain-text comments or files don't get "
"magically encrypted afterwards). Private messages are encrypted always to be "
"readable only by recipient and sender. Attachments follow the privacy rules "
"of the document, they're attached to. </p><p>- As is the case with all "
"internet-communications, this small fact is true for classified ads too : "
"<span style=\" font-style:italic;\">once something gets posted online, there "
"is no way to remove it from network</span>. </p><p>- Data encryption "
"implementation for content is OpenSSL, relying mostly on algorithms RSA-2048 "
"and AES-256. </p><p>- While connections between nodes are implemented using "
"SSL, other nodes inside network do get to know what content is being "
"transmitted in neighboring nodes. While there is no central point for easily "
"collecting this information about particular classification or operator, "
"operators still should expect no privacy regarding their doings online, "
"although some effort has been been put into hiding <span style=\" "
"font-style:italic;\">contents</span> of private messages and private "
"profiles. </p><p>Programming was (mostly) done by Antti Järvinen, artwork by "
