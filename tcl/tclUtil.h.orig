     * 
     * @param aAboutComboBoxText "about" part of group string. This is checked
     *            against localized strings in datamodel and user types
     *            "Veneet" (boats in finnish) and happens to have finnish
     *            locale, then datamodel will catch the situation and
     *            return "Boats" - idea is that any boat ad will go to 
     *            same group regardless of locale. 
     * @param aConcernsComboBoxText "concerns" e.g. the verb part of
     *            group string.
