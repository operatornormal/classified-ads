/**
 * @brief Class providing TCL interpreter services
 *
 * This class wraps TCL interpreter in safe mode. This class
 * is intended to be used so that, this is instantiated once
 * and deleted at application shutdown. One TCL program may be
 * running at same time - restriction of Tk is that one
 * instance per process only.
 *
 * This is a thread and it is supposed to be used so that
 * class is instantiated, setScript() method is called,
 * followed by start(). Start may be called multiple times,
 * calling start() when thread is already executing has
 * no effect.
 *
 * Additionally this implements commands for accessing profiles
 * and classified ads from within TCL interpreter, see for
 * example @ref listItemsCmd or @ref getProfileCmd that appear
 * as commands "listProfiles" and "getProfile" inside interpreter.
