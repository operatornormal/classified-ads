/**
 * @brief Class for mixing together 0-n audio streams
 *
 * This class has 2 types of input and 2 types of output.
 *  Input type 1: locally captured microphone data
 *  Input type 2: 0-n streams sent from remote nodes
 *  Output type 1: Audio intended for playback from local loudspeaker
 *  Output type 2: Audio intended to be sent to remote nodes
 * Depending on situation this class will mix a bit differently.
 * If there is only type 1 input and 1 type 2 stream then no mixing
 * will occur: input type  2 becomes output type 1 and that's it.
 * If there is more than 1 streams to mix together then mixer will
 * actually mix.
