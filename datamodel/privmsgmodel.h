/**
 * @brief This is is part of datamodel for storing private messages
 *
 * Encryption keys related to messages need to be done using
 * ContentEncryptionModel but after it has done its job,
 * this part of datamodel handles that actual message-content.
 *
 * Private messages are handled differently in (at least) one
 * way worth mentioning: when other published content is
 * sent over network, the content is accompanied by public key
 * used to sign the content. Private messages have the public
 * key of the content inside the content and the content
 * is encrypted. This means 2 things:
 *  - only the recipient knows who sent
 *  - only the recipient can verify integrity of the data
 * so, while storing messages here, we do not try to verify.
 * When user opens a message, it is first de-crypted and
 * key obtained from inside, then verification takes place.
