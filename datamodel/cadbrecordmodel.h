     * @brief method for storing and publishing a database record. 
     * 
     * Database records are published to the network when
     * persisted. There is separate local storage for
     * data not meant to be shared at the network but
     * database records do get published to all nodes
     * in the network. 
     *
     * @param aRecord The db record to be published
     * @param aRecordReaders Optional list of profile fingerprints
     *        to whom the record will be encrypted to. Only those profiles
     *        will be able to read the record. This list is considered only when
     *        @ref CaDbRecord::iIsEncrypted is true. If record is set to
     *        be encrypted, and this list is empty, the readers of the currently
     *        selected profile will be the readers of the record. If profile 
     *        is public ( there is no list of readers ) and record is set to
     *        be encrypted then this list must contain at least one profile. 
     * @return empty string if success, or error message

    /**
     * Method for retrieving db records. See @ref CaDbRecord for records
     * being fetched. Limiting criteria can be specified using several
     * optional parameters. Those parameters are considered together using
     * "AND" operation, meaning they all need to be satisfied at the
     * same time for a record to be returned. For example, if both "by sender"
     * and "modified after" parameters are given, result set contains only
     * records from that given profile and whose publish time is after
     * given time. 
     *
     * This may have a side-effect when search terms are broad (like, only
     * collection specified) and it may be suspected that the search is
     * not fully served what it comes to potential resultset, this method
     * may give the query to @ref DbRecordRetrievalEngine that will
     * spam the network with the query. More records from neighboring network nodes
     * fitting the search criteria may then start appearing into database. 
     * TCL app that originated the query will receive notifications about 
     * new records but it will still need to use this same method here to 
     * fetch contents of the new records. In particular, if record is queried 
     * using aById parameter and the record is found, then no network-query is 
     * started. 
     *
     * @param aFromCollection Returns records whose @ref CaDbRecord::iCollectionId
     *        match this parameter. Either this or aById argument must be 
     *        given. Specifying only this will return whole collection 
     *        that may be huge. 
     * @param aById Returns record whose @ref CaDbRecord::iRecordId matches. Result-set
     *        is either empty or contains one record. If user passes KNullHash
     *        here then value of this argument is simply ignored and search
     *        method will return records fitting criteria stated by other
     *        method arguments like aBySearchPhrase. In theory it is possible
     *        that 2 users end up publishing a record with same id but that
     *        should be fairly rare occasion. 
     * @param aModifiedAfter Returns records that have last been modified after
     *        given time. Time of modification is stored in 
     *        @ref CaDbRecord::iTimeOfPublish.
     * @param aModifiedBefore Returns records that have last been modified before
     *        given time. 
     * @param aByHavingNumberMoreThan Returns records whose 
     *        @ref CaDbRecord::iSearchNumber
     *        is more or equal than number given here. 
     * @param aByHavingNumberLessThan Returns records whose 
     *        @ref CaDbRecord::iSearchNumber
     *        is less or equal than number given here. 
     * @param aBySearchPhrase Returns records whose 
     *        @ref CaDbRecord::iSearchPhrase matches
     *        the string given here, according to rules of sqlite FTS string matching
     *        implementation. 
     * @param aBySender Returns only records published by profile given in this 
     *        argument.
     * @param aForPublish if set to true, data-parts of the records are 
     *        returned un-altered from database. Normally records are
     *        de-crypted and un-compressed before getting returned
     *        but if record is meant to be sent to another node, the
     *        bitstream must be exactly the one that got signed. 
     * 
     * @return Pointer array of db records. Caller is responsible for deleting the
     *         returned records.
