Description: Program for displaying classified advertisement items
 Classified ads is an attempt to re-produce parts of the functionality
 that went away when usenet news ceased to exist. This attempt tries to
 fix the problem of disappearing news-servers so that there is no
 servers required; data storage is implemented inside client
 applications that users are running. Features of the program
 currently include
  * Posting of ads online, with categorization.
  * Replying to ads either in public or privately to operator.
  * Binary attachments to posts.
  * Providing basic data of operators
  * Basic searching of content based on words.
