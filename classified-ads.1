.SH NAME
classified-ads \- Program for posting ads online for others to see
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B classified-ads
.SH DESCRIPTION
Classified ads is a program for online communications. 
Main features include server-less design, public announcements,
private messages, user data and comments. For longer explanation
of the program, please see "About" dialog inside the program. 
.SH FILES
For each individual user a file $HOME/.classified_ads/sqlite_db is 
created. This is a normal sqlite database that contains state of
the program. For backup purpose a copy may be made and later restored
while the program is not running. Restoring an old file fully resets the
programs state to moment when backup was taken. 

Upon uninstall of the program, the datafile is left lingering around.
Users who are sure they'll never user the program again should delete
the file by hand. Note that users encryption keys are inside this
file among other data so deleting the file will affect users ability
to access private messages later.
