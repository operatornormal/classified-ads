# The file turt-transparent.xcf is highest-resolution version available
# of the turtle logo. It is not used in runtime in that high-res but instead
# converted to 2 smaller resolutions. This makefile handles the resizing
# using imagemagick. If turt-transparent.xcf is modified, say "make all"
# in this directory to generate the small-resolution versions that are
# used at build stage.
