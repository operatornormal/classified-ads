/**
 * @brief Network-connection logic relating fetching db records from DHT
 *
 * Special retrieval logic for records of distributed db records only.
 * See also @ref RetrievalEngine that is used to fetch classified ads
 * or binary files. @ref RetrievalEngine is limited to fetching one
 * item at time, with db records we may have multiple collections open
 * at the same time and it may be necessary to fetch from all of those,
 * and at the same time honouring possible search terms that user
 * may have given. 
 *
 * Method @startRetrieving is called via controller due to users activity
 * usually inside TCL program. If conditions are met, this class locates
 * nodes in the network that store the desired collection and repeates
 * the query to those nodes in hope to retrieve more records matching the
 * query.
