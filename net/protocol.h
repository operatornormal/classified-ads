 * between peers as protocol entries.
 *
 * Possible messages are
 * - Node greeting in the beginning. There node may advertise
 *   other available addresses and date when last in contact
 *   with this node or peers in the vicinity. This should
 *   be sent first by both parties.
 * - Node listing. Basically this is just up-to-date list of
 *   known peers, in immediate vicinity and then around
 *   the ring ; each node should try to produce list
 *   of high-quality nodes for this list.

// node greeting has following fields, each is unsigned
// 8-bit if not otherwise stated, 32-bit integers are
// in network byte order:
// 1. protocol version for this node. Note that identifies
//    both this message and the protocol version. Later we
//    may invent protocol version xyz that will then
//    identify node and its protocol with some other
//    number.

// 3. node greeting as qCompress()ed JSon
//
// ok, next thing to define is our easiest message type, random numbers.
// idea for this is this: upon connect node sends node greeting.
// node greeting contains hash and outside ip addr. suppose someone
// is eavesdropping the tsl tcp connection she already has some known
// plaintext in there, in the very first real datapacket transmitted,
// in known offset so .. say, the original tsl key was done using bad
// random number and in addition the listener knows some plaintext
// inside it might be possible to brute-force the key.
