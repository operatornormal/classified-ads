 * @brief Network-related logic for handling voice channel between nodes
 *
 * "Voice call" is a bit different from persisted content handling:
 * It happens between, nodes, not between operators. It has realtime-
 * requirements and does not directly store anything on data
 * storage.
 *
 * This class contains networking-related logic and audio stream
 * handling. Separate UI must be built on top of this. This inherits
 * QAbstractTableModel to provide easy access for UI-components
 * to calldata.
 *
 * For actual call data handling see @ref AudioMixer and other classes
 * in the same directory.
