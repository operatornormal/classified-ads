In order to successfully run the tests, first backup file
$HOME/.classified_ads/sqlite_db 
then remove the file, then run the tests. They're not destructive
but make certain assumptions and they do manipulate trust 
list of profile that they manage to open, if they can. If you
have profile with password 'salasana' it will be used in
tests. 

If the database is removed prior to running tests, you'll
exercise also database creation code so code coverage
gets slightly better .. but is still bad. 

After tests have been run, the database file may be safely
thrown away and original moved back. If you run the test 
program twice, you should still get 100% pass rate but on 
second run it do the run using slightly different code 
paths because the database is already there.
